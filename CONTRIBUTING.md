# Contributing to ObsidianUI

## Introduction

ObsidianUI welcomes students and contributors interested in improving the project through Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and general open-source contributions. ObsidianUI is an open-source React component library focused on reusable, accessible, and customizable UI components for modern web applications.

This document provides guidance on how to prepare a strong GSoC proposal and how to communicate with the maintainers before submitting your proposal.

## Getting Started

Before submitting a proposal or contributing code, contributors should:

- Explore the ObsidianUI repository and documentation  
- Clone the repository and run the project locally  
- Review open issues, pull requests, and discussions  
- Understand the project structure, coding standards, and roadmap

## Google Summer of Code Proposal Guidelines

A strong proposal should be clear, technical, and realistic. It should include the following sections:

### 1. Problem Statement
Describe what you plan to build or improve and why it is important for ObsidianUI users and the broader web development ecosystem.

---

### 2. Technical Approach
Explain your implementation plan in detail, including:

- Architecture and design decisions  
- Technologies and tools you will use  
- How your solution integrates with the existing codebase  
- Any diagrams or pseudocode (optional but encouraged)  

---

### 3. Timeline and Milestones
Provide a structured timeline for the GSoC period, including:

- Design phase  
- Implementation milestones  
- Testing and documentation  
- Final evaluation and deliverables  

Include buffer time for unexpected challenges.

---

### 4. Relevant Experience
Share your background and experience, including:

- Open-source contributions (GitHub links)  
- Personal or academic projects  
- Experience with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or related technologies  
- Any previous mentoring or community involvement  

---

### 5. Risk Assessment
Identify potential technical or scheduling risks and explain how you plan to mitigate them.

---

### 6. Long-Term Commitment
Explain how you plan to continue contributing to ObsidianUI after the GSoC program ends.
